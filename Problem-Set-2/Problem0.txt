Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year 
if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment required by the credit card company each month.

The following variables contain values as described below:
    1) balance - the outstanding balance on the credit card
    2) annualInterestRate - annual interest rate as a decimal
    3) monthlyPaymentRate - minimum monthly payment rate as a decimal

A summary of the required math is found below:
    Monthly interest rate= (Annual interest rate) / 12.0
    Minimum monthly payment = (Minimum monthly payment rate) x (Previous balance)
    Monthly unpaid balance = (Previous balance) - (Minimum monthly payment)
    Updated balance each month = (Monthly unpaid balance) + (Monthly interest rate x Monthly unpaid balance)
